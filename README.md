# MyBlendRC: Menu Based Keybinding System
- Press <kbd>Space</kbd> and a menu will popup.
- Press <kbd>Q</kbd> and extended quick access menu will popup.
- Or, you can use search tools in Blender to access these operators.
- In the pop-up menu, press the first letter of the operator and it will be automatically executed. For example, if you want to flip camera view, push <kbd>Space</kbd> <kbd>F</kbd> sequentially, like 'Vim' keybindings.
